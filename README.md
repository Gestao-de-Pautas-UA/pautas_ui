### Description
This interface was developed to create a modern way for professors to manage, post and sign final grades sheets of the disciplines he/she is responsible for. It is a new version from the old platform (paco) that was complicated and outdated. The frontend was built using **React**, **NextJs** and **Axios**, managed through this github repository and used the AMA's API (Portuguese governmental agency for admnistrative modernization) to sign documents using the professor's personal digital key.
